Clone repos as bare into a newly created folder by using the `{{aka}}` subcommand followed by the `ssh` URL for the repo.

Bare repos are repos that do not have a working directory, which means they only contain the git database without checked out files.
Bare repos also have a `.git` suffix.

To checkout a working directory, use the `fidi add` subcommand.
