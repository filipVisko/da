The `{{aka}}` subcommand provides a command line wrapper around your git client to replace standard branching with git worktrees.
Intended to completely replace the vanila git commands for managing branches like `checkout -b` and `branch`.
Use shell aliases to make this transition easier.

To get started, `clone` a repo and then `add` a worktree.
If you want to checkout a remote branch locally, `add` a worktree with the same name.

Here's a video which explains the workflow the {{aka}} subcommand is emulating `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uEqYw-N8uE`.
