To delete a worktree and its associated branch reference, use the `{{aka}}` command followed by the name of the branch.

This will remove the worktree folder and its contents, as well as delete the branch reference from the bare repo.
Any changes you've made in the worktree will be lost, so make sure to save your work before deleting the worktree.
